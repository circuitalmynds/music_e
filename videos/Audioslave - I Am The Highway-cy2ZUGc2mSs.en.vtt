00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.589
Pearls and swine bereft of me
Long and weary my road has been

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:06.880
I was lost in the cities
Alone in the hills

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:20.409
No sorrow or pitty
For leaving I feel

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:28.390
I am not your rolling wheels
I am a highway

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.550
I am not your carpet ride
I am the sky

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.550
Friends and liars
Don't wait for me

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.550
Cause I'll get on
All by myself

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.920
I put millions of miles
Under my heels

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:54.250
And still too close to you
I feel

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:34.080
I am not your rolling wheels
I am the highway

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:51.260
I am not your carpet ride
I am the sky

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:07.010
I am not your blowing wind
I am the lightning

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:21.110
I am not your autumn moon
I am the night

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.719
The night

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:36.439
I am not your rolling wheels
I am the highway

00:03:36.439 --> 00:04:55.750
I am not your carpet ride
I am the sky

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.500
I am not your blowing wind
I am the lightining

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:26.710
I am not your autumn moon
I am the night
