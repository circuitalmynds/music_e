"Buck Owens and the Buckaroos Live At Caregie Hall" was recorded live at Carnegie Hall New York City 1966,as Buck Owens and his Buckaroos became the second country band ever to perform there.Originally released on Capitol Records it was re-issued on CD in 2000 by Sundazed Records. This is the Capitol album. I have had this since its release in 1966. No edits or "cutting off" the ends like the others on YouTube. Because of length, there are 2 parts - this is part 1. The total album time is 50 minutes.
